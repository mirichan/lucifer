## Lucifer UI

This is VERY experimental. Multithreading stuff is kinda bleeding edge atm and isn't yet supported by Trunk. It's tedious to manage manually, and there's nothing particularly wrong with my JS worker implementation. It'll be easier to make improvements there than with Yew for the time being.

Currently, `blueprint.css` has to be manually kept in sync.
Yewprint has tools for this, but it's non-trivial to have everything Just Work™️ with Trunk, so I'm not bothering with that for now.

Look into that later: https://github.com/yewprint/yewprint
